this scene really shows the history and past of my relationships. the dead flowers she used to give me stay on the shelf, ever decaying. the lego flower never decays, a constant reminder that certain types of love dont quite die, they stagnate, they continue to act as simple displays. the audio is taken from my window back home in Taos. it reminds me that no matter what happens, sometimes things dont change. my whole life there have been these crickets, and they will continue long after i die. it reminds me of the eternality of love.

this duck came up to me. most likely searching for food, but maybe searching for companionship. there really were no other ducks around. like my song, this duck was truly on its LONESOME. that is until it chose to find company in me I suppose? for the audio, although this song symbolizes loneliness, i found friends amongst the birds that play on my window. this audio shares their songs and reminds me that even when you may feel alone, that is never quite the case. even birds can give company.

looking at this scene, i honestly felt like the ladder. the only support holding up the person repairing the house. if the ladder moves, it all collapses, no progress is made, the person is hurt. in truth, i was indeed the ladder and i did indeed move. stagnating progress, hurting the climber. for the audio, i recorded this as i observed an orchestra practice through a window. it honestly sounded like something falling, or rising. each individual piece helps the orchestra fall, just as the ladder supports the individual, the instrmuments support eachother.

The bag is anyone who needs to hold on. the tree is anyone willing to help them hold on. in this sense, I felt like the tree offering support for the bag. not necessarily choosing to do so, but helping none the less. ultimately it is the wind, or the strength of the plastic that maintains its grip on the tree. without it, the bag floats into the unknown, drowns in the sea of air and land. am i the bag? the tree? the wind? for the audio, i recorded this back home fishing with my father. the wind was powerful and began to vibrate the string creating what can only be described as an Aeolian Harp. just as the wind may blow the bag to the unknown, it shows that powerful and uncontrollable forces can also create beauty, in this case that beauty is the natural music you hear.
